Differences from original non-maven source tree:
* src/com/bulletphysics/demos/ removed (they will be in separate artifact)
* sources of jstackalloc merged with main source tree and they are parially
  (the part which responsible of instrumentation) excluded from jar-creating
  process.
* unneded parts (as lib/ directory, since all dependencies are now handled by
  maven, parts of netbeans build-system, dist/, and empty test/) were removed.
